# NoisyD-CT
Official PyTorch implementation of the paper "Noisy Disentanglement with Tri-stage Training for Noise-Robust Speech Recognition"，submitted to Applied Acoustics.

## Dataset
The entire dataset is divided into two parts: clean speech and noisy speech. The clean speech is sourced from the LibriSpeech dataset, and synthetic noisy speech is generated by mixing noise samples from the CHiME-4 dataset with clean recordings from LibriSpeech at random SNRs ranging from –5dB to 15dB and a random one of the four distinct environments(BUS,CAF,PED,STR).

The data folder contains three subfolders: `train`, `dev`, and `test`. Each subfolders have several subsets, each subset contains the following files：
* `wav.scp`: Clean and noisy speech
* `text`: Ground truth 

If the subfolders is `train`, the subsets of it include a special file: 
* `clean.scp`: The **clean speech** that corresponds one-to-one to the speech in the `wav.scp` file.

To adapt the `.scp` files to your local environment, you can manually update the file paths to reflect your local data locations. Alternatively, you can utilize the `noisyspeech_simulation.py` script to dynamically generate noisy speech and ensure their paths are correctly updated in the `.scp` files.

## Training
We will release the core code for training the efficient model upon the acceptance of the paper.
